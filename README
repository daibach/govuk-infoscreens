# GOV.UK Info Screens

This is a dashboard for showing how content was being published on the GOV.UK
website (https://www.gov.uk).

It worked by reading notifications from a Gmail inbox, processing them, and
storing in a database.

The application uses PHP, MySQL, Gmail and the CodeIgniter Framework
(version 2.1.0)
